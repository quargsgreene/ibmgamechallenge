The purpose of this project is to introduce and educate users about superposition, quantum entanglement, and quantum time revival. 

Classical GOL
Cells
A grid, most cells have 8 neighbors
Irreversible 

Quantum GOL
Qubits (can be in superposition)
A 1D arrangement of qubits
Entanglement between qubits and their neighbors
Reversible
